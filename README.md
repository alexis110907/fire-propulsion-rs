# fire-propulsion-rs
Project that mimics the propulsion firing of a satellite in Rust

To compile code:
    1. Verified that rust is installed:
        rustc --version
    2. If not installed, install rust:
        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    3. Source profile:
        source $HOME/.cargo/env
    4. Compile code:
        rustc fire_propulsion.rs -o fire_propulsion

To Run code:
    ./fire_propulsion

Choosing to code in Rust:
    First time coding in Rust and wanted to give it a try. Tried implementing with the same algorithm used in my C++ implementation.
